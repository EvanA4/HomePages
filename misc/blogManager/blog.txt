Hey, Evan! Here's an Example Blog

Add description below:
This neat little fake blog contains a bunch of good reference material for writing future blogs. If you aren't Evan, feel free to check it out anyways!

Add full blog text below:
            <H1>Blog Example: Everything In One Place</H1>
            <p>If you haven't immediately noticed, this blog style is heavily inspired by GitHub's unique markdown documents.</p>
            <H2>Motivation Behind This Blog</H2>
            <p>
                In my GitHub projects, I've always tried to explaining some about how the project works to inspire any onlookers to try it themselves.
                This blog is another way of explaining how my website works. I hope some fellow computer nerds enjoy seeing behind the scenes and try
                to implement this themselves!
            </p>
            <H3>So What About a <i>REAL</i> Blog?</H3>
            <p>
                My first blog is likely going to be explaining how this site works or how
                my <a href="https://github.com/EvanA4/CNNChess" className="text-blue-400"><u>chess bot</u></a> works (it's terrible, by the way).
                Wanna guess what the hardest part of developing this website was? It was learning how to write shaders for the fancy space simulation
                at the top of the home page. It took like two full months, but half of the struggle was coming home from working full-time at ORNL as
                a SULI intern just to code even more.
            </p>
            <H3>The Rest of This Blog</H3>
            <p>
                The rest of this blog is just going to demonstrate other elements I can add to my blogs for visual flare. I can't really come up with
                a cool segway, so I just made this additional subsection.

            <Textblock>Here is some less dramatic stuff.</Textblock>
            <p>To print something to the console in JavaScript, simply write <Code>console.log("Hello world!")</Code></p>
            <p>Take a look at this <a href="https://google.com" className="text-blue-400"><u>link</u></a> to Google!</p>

                This is a lot of information, so sit down! <br/>
                Check out all of these individual lines! <br/>
                Oh yeah, this baby *pat pat* can fit so many lines in it.
